Notes for Fools, I Will Destroy You All! (Working Title):

This was a project I worked on in my off time. I wanted to see if  I could do an old-style text adventure game, especially after going through some computer science courses where phrases like “context-free grammar” were used. This was the result. It is not the best implementation, nor is this version entirely bug free. It is, at least on my end, workable. 

This should be a warning sign because programmers make terrible testers. I thought I would give the player a few tips though:

1. Check to see if there’s some cheat that you might glean from looking at the source code if you get stuck.

2. In-game help is available. Use it as a guide.

3. There are 50 ‘rooms’ in the game. This was done to keep the size down. You do not need to search them all to complete the game.

4. In rooms 26-48, you can search the area and you might find something useful.

5. Be sure to read any notes you come across. The story could be stronger, but this was initially supposed to be a graphical project.

Good luck!
